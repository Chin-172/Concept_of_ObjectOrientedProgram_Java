**Static Non-Access Modifier**

> *This variable is used for memory management and the first thing being referenced while loading a class.*
> **Static Variable:** *If a variable is declared as static, then only a **single copy** of the variable is created and shared among all the objects. Thus any change made to the variable by one object will be reflected in other others.*
> **Static Class:** *Static keyword can only be used with nested classes.*
> **Static Methods:** *Since Static Methods are referenced by class name thus can only access static member variables and other static methods. Static method modify the static variable only*
